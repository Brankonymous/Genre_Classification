# Genre_Classification
Comparing 4 methods for genre classification (Fingerprint, Spectrum, MFCC and LPCC method)

Every method has different features extracted from audio signal processing. 
Folder "Combining features (Matlab Neural Network)" is sorted for Matlab neural network testing. 
All results are given in folder "Confusion Matrix (Matlab Neural Network)".
Folders "database" and "genres" are not uploaded because they are NATA and GTZAN base respectively and they are too big in size.
